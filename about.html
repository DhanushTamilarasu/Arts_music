    <p><i><b>An electric guitar is a guitar that requires external amplification in order to be 
            heard at typical performance volumes, <br>unlike a standard  acoustic guitar. It uses one or
            more pickups to convert the vibration of <br>its strings into electricalsignals, which ultim_
            ately are reproduced as sound by loudspeakers.</p>
    <p><i><b>Electric guitars feature devices called pickups embedded in their bodies.<br> Pickups convert
             the vibrations of the strings into an electric signal,<br> which is then sent to an amplifier 
             over a shielded cable. The amplifier converts <br>the electric signal into sound and plays it.</p>
